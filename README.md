# Archived repository no longer used

# Podinfo Application Source Repository

## Quickstart

If you want to get started quickly you can run the demo by using a script at the CLI:
```
cd demo
./01-edit-container-and-increment-versions.sh
```
Read the instructions and follow the prompts, press a key to continue the script.

## Introduction

This is the source code repository for the application. 

This is a monorepo, so all the environments are in the main branch.  
The environments are referenced by flux kustomizations from each cluster to the /environments/NAME directory.

There are 5 environments:
- 'dev' and 'dev-test', for the developers use,
- 'uat' or user acceptance testing, used by the testers,
- 'stg' or staging (managed like production) and
- 'prod' or production.

Commits should be done in a feature branch not in the main branch.

Each push by the developer of files in /pkg or /cmd will trigger a temporary build of the container and deploy to the 'dev' cluster.
This happens quickly, within 2-4 minutes.

After the developer is ready to release their changes, they modify the Helmchart in /charts/podinfo/Chart.yaml
- incrementing the version number of the chart
- incrementing the version of the container to include in the release.

A PR from the feature branch is then made against the main branch, this triggers the CI testing.
The CI tests then:
- Checks the version numbers were incremented
- builds the release container version

When the github actions complete, the PR can be approved and merged to main.

This runs the chart-releaser process to release the Helm Chart in the github repository, which acts as a Helm repository.

The dev-test cluster detects the new chart in the Helm Repository and installs it automatically.

Then each cluster sends a webhook to the github repo when the Helm chart is 'ready'.
This creates a PR for each environment cluster to promote across each one.
i.e.

- dev-test pulls new Helm chart 
- PR created for 'uat' 
- Approve 
- Deploys chart to 'uat'
- PR created for 'stg' 
- Approve 
- Deploys chart to 'stg' 
- PR created for 'prod' 
- Approve 
- Deploys chart to 'prod' 


You can show the podinfo application from each of the clusters to visibly show the progressing versions of the app.

### Demo Features
1. Demostrate GitOps and policy checking across a multi-stage build pipeline.
2. Show a development environment with "instant" image deployment (uses a github action).
3. Show a production environment that requires a pull request to deploy a new image.
4. Show one design pattern for GitOps application promotion: monorepo, instant developer deployment, pull request gate
